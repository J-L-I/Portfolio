                Welcome and thanks for checking out my website.<br />  I'm a budding software engineer looking for new opportunities.<br />
                This site is meant to be an overview of my skills, current projects, and a small introduction to me as a person.<br />
                My current focus is building a portfolio of projects, with this site being one of them.<br />
